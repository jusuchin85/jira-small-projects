Preparation before you begin:

1.  Run the following SQL query for your JIRA database, replacing <YOUR_PROJECT_KEY>
    with the project key that you are interested in:

    select id, filename from fileattachment where issueid in (
                     select id from jiraissue where pkey like '<YOUR_PROJECT_KEY>%');

2.  Save the result to a CSV file.
3.  Edit the CSV file to exclude the headers and change the delimeter to ','.

How to use this script:

1.  Open the script for editing
2.  Under MAIN, set the relevant <JIRA_HOME>/data/attachments/<PROJECT_KEY> for the
    project that you wish its attachments to be manipulated.

    An example of this would be:

    MAIN=/data/jira-home/data/attachments/TEST

3.  Under (cd $MAIN/DUCR-$i) and (for f in $MAIN/DUCR-$i/*) lines, change 'DUCR' to
    your project key.

    For example:

    cd $MAIN/TEST-$i
    
    for f in $MAIN/TEST-$i/*

4.  Also, set the path of your CSV file in the (done < /home/jalex/Desktop/TEMP/DUCR/attachment.csv)
    section. Using absolute path is recommended.
